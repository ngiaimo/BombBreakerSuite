Tools to solve modules in the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". Made in GameMaker: Studio.

This is a work in progress. This tool will provide a hub and a set of tools to be able to solve modules in Keep Talking.

Current Modules

"Working" modules
-----------

* Normal Wires
* Keypads
* The Button
* Complicated Wires
* Needy Module: Knob
* Wire Sequences
* Passwords

Planned
-----------

* Simon Says

Possible
-----------

* Morse Code
* Who's on First
* Mazes

Finalized
-----------

* N/A

Note: working modules have their logic figured out and can be used but have a rough UI and need usability improvements. Possible modules are ones that I am either not sure if I will do it or if I do, still considering if there is any way to improve the process.
